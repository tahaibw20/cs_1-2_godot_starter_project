# Look at "Attack Timing and Cooldowns" documentation
# You need: attack distance, attack damage, attack timing variables

# This should call the player's change_health function with negative damage

# TODO: Add comprehensive debug print statements
# Print current state, distance to player, attack timers, etc.
